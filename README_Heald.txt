EECS 560 Data Structures Lab04 - Adam Heald

Testing: To run the program, use the make command and then run the Lab04 executable.
  My testing for this program consisted of testing very small AVL trees of size 3 and using those to test my rotations and insertions on.
  Once those tests were complete I would enter the full data set. Each time this worked.
  Then I tested my deletions in the same manner. I would delete the target node, and then review the resultng AVL tree to verify its correctness.

Notes:
  The program only supports cities of single words. This is why some of my cities do have a space where they should. e.g. Kansas City is really KansasCity in the db.
